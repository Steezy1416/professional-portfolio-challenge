## My thought process...

Where to start? Thats the question i asked myself when starting this project. I knew that the first thing I wanted to do is start designing the website for mobile first and then scale up. So I drew a wireframe to visuallise and get an idea of what I wanted my webpage to look like.

![Mock-up-one](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105886307/186806179-96c86315-05db-4832-8195-d6b4765ddf10.jpg)

This proved to be helpful because it gave me an idea of what I wanted. And with that I started writting the html code structuring it the way I believed the boxes should be. For example I knew the projects were going to be displayed as flexbox so I added a "wrapper" around the code that was going to be used for the projects section. For example:

```html

    <div class="wrapper">

            <section class="project first-project">
                <h4 class="project-title">Prework Study Guide</h4>
                <a href="https://steezy1416.github.io/prework-study-guide/" target="_blank">
                    <img class="image" src="./assets/images/pre-work.png" alt="preview of the prework study guide website showing a header and cards with information inside them.">
                </a>
            </section>          
    </div>

```

Once I finished the basic html format I started working on the css and I would change the html structure as I went along by adding class names, containers, and more. The css was alot of trial and error but once the initial phone phase was done all I had to do was make it responsive on different screentypes. I did this by adjusted different attributes for different sizes. When all of that was finished I just made some final style changes to improve the appearance of the page and clean up the structure of my code.
